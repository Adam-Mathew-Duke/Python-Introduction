# built in python functions
# pre packed with ready to use functions
# each designed to perform a specific task with different data types
# this is the python toolbox

# abs strips off the negative sign e.g. flips a negative to a positive
# using this built in fuction you will always get the positive sign on the number
print (abs(-23))

# bool function
# you can see this one as the truth checker
# 0 = false
# 1 = true
# bool None returns false
# bool 0 returns false
# bool 1 returns true
# bool 100 returns true
print(bool(None))

# shines a light on the data type argument to show you all the methods that can be applied
print(dir('hello'))

# getting help with a method using the in built help function
print(help('hello'.upper))

# eval method executes a string - converts a string to python code
# what could you use this for? Maybe the user could input a string and you could evaluate the code to help
# them learn python?
sent = 'print("hi")'
eval(sent) # used for a single line of code
exec(sent) # used for multiple lines of code

# converting data types
# str convert to string
print ('hello ' + str(100))

# type converion functions
# int and float are useful when you want to convert from string to numeric data
print (int(123)+456)
print (float(1.23)+2)
