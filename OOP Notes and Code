# Object Orientated Programming (OOP)

'''
class: (defines what a dog is)
properities: name, breed, age, behaviours
methods: bark, eat, sleep
a class is a concept that describes what a dog is and wha it can do.
object is an instance of a class
create two objects from the dog class
objects: Fido and Buddy
have the same methods as each other
but have unique properities
Properities: Fido, 3, german shepard...
once you have made a dog CLASS
then you can create as many dog OBJECTS as you need
saving you the time of defining dogs again and again
Classes help you to organise and structure you code even better
by creating a class dog you can create any number of dog objects
each dog object has it's own set of attributes and behavours
object oriented programming allows you to create structured, intuitive
and re-usable code.
A class is a blueprint or a plan
the class can contain some basic information that every person has
the class is not a specific person just a general idea of what a person is
the init function allows us to setup attribues when we create a new person object
self is a refeence to the current instance of this class
the paramaters name and age are passed in to define what this person object will be
lets now create an instance of our class which is called an object
where p is an instance of our person class or a person object
everytime we create a person object we will define a name and an aage
here Bob and 22 are the attribues of the P1 object
lets create some methods in our class
classes are a reflection of how humans think about the world around them!

class Person:
    
    def __init__(self,name,age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        
    def getName(self):
        return self.name
        
    def getAge(self):
        return self.age
        
p1 = Person("Bob",22)
print (p1.getName())
print (p1.getAge())
