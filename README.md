A Quick and Easy Intro to Python Programming
URL: https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/
  
  1. My code from working through the course exercises and concepts.
  2. My own programs to further explore ideas from the course and implement my own ideas.

I really enjoyed the course overall and I found it quite easy. Now I'm going to:
  
  1. Move onto a bigger Python course
  2. Fill the gaps in my knowledge
  3. Keep creating my own programs using everything I have learnt
