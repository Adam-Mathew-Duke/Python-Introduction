I am learning and exploring the Python programming language. This is a place to store my code, little programs and ideas. I'm a bit obsessed with Magic The Gathering (MTG) at the moment so much of my code is focused on cards and their monetary values.

Programs:
1. MTG Card Price program - MTG Card Price.zip
