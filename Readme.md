## Python Introduction

### Overview
This repository contains the projects and exercises from my journey through an introduction to Python programming. It serves as a record of my learning process, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and practical applications.

### Course Folder
The Course Folder includes coding exercises from the Introduction to Python course. These exercises cover key topics such as:

* Variables, operators and strings
* Arthimitic operations
* Lists, dictionaries and tuples
* If, For and While loops
* Try and except (error handling)
* User and built in Python functions
* Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
* Class and Class Inheritance

Each exercise is aimed at reinforcing foundational skills and understanding core concepts in Python.

### Programs Folder
The Programs Folder contains my own Python programs, created to apply the concepts learned in the course. These projects go beyond the exercises and demonstrate how Iâ€™ve integrated Python into small, functional programs. Examples include:

* Card suits and Card suits - V1
* MTG arithmetic
* MTG concatenation
* MTG for loops
* MTG listing
* MTG price
* MTG strings
* MTG variables

Each program reflects my growing confidence in writing clean, functional Python code.
