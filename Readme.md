## Python Introduction

# Overview
This repository contains the projects and exercises from my journey through an introduction to Python programming. It serves as a record of my learning process, focusing on fundamental programming concepts and practical applications.

# Course Folder
The Course folder includes coding exercises from the Introduction to Python course. These exercises cover key topics such as:

* Variables, operators and strings
* Arthimitic operations
* Lists, dictionaries and tuples
* If, For and While loops
* Try and except (error handling)
* User and built in Python functions
* Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
* Class and Class Inheritance

Each exercise is aimed at reinforcing foundational skills and understanding core concepts in Python.

App Folder
The App folder contains my own Python programs, created to apply the concepts learned in the course. These projects go beyond the exercises and demonstrate how Iâ€™ve integrated Python into small, functional programs. Examples include:

*

Each program reflects my growing confidence in writing clean, functional Python code.
