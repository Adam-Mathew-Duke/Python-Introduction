# introduction to for loops
# good for interating over data structure like lists and tuples
list_1 = ['Apple','Grapes','Pear'] # list has [ ]
tup_1 = (2,6,10) # random values in the tuple

# for x in data structure
# print x
for item in list_1:
    print (item)
    
for item in tup_1:
    print(x)
    
# the range function does not include the end index
# 0 start of range
# 11 is the end of the range (last index is not included)
# 2 is the increment factor (default is 1)
for i in range(0,11,2):
    print(i)

# print the first 10 multiples of 5
# 5 goes into 50. 10 times
# add one more number so it includes a final index of 50
for i in range(5,51,5):
    print(i)

# a nested for loop
for i in range (0,5)
    for j in range (0,3)
        print(i*j)
