# introduction to while loops
# useful when using a variable
# useful whe you don't know how many times you need to iterate on a loop
# keep executing while a condition is true
# control statements: break, control and pass
# break if you want to exit the loop early
# continue if you want to skip the current interation and move onto the next
# pass will continue the flow of the while loop and take no action useful as a placeholder in your program
c = 0
while c < 5:
    c = c + 1
    if c == 3:
        #continue # will not print 3
        #break # will print up to 2
        pass # will take no action
    print(c)
